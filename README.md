# Cosine_similarity
## Introduces
Use cosine_similarity or Euclidean distance to calculate the correlation between images and text fragments, then query them and return results with high to low correlation.
## Descriptions
- Extract features and save those features as vectors into vector.pkl file. Also save the path of the images with path.pkl
- Extract feature vectors from required image or text then compare them by cosine_similarity or Euclidean distance with all previously saved vectors
